## Branching Model

Our default branch is `dev`. When starting development work, please create a new branch based on `dev`. Once your changes are ready, create a pull request targeting the `dev` branch.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
2. Checkout the `dev` branch as your starting point for development.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your specific contribution. Give it a descriptive and concise name that reflects the nature of your changes.
2. Make changes, commit them frequently with clear and meaningful commit messages.
3. Push your branch regularly to the remote repository.
4. When your changes are complete, create a pull request targeting the `dev` branch.
5. Ensure your pull request includes a clear and concise description of the changes made.
6. Be open to feedback and iterate on your changes as necessary.
7. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `dev` branch.
